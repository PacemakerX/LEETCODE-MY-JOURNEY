## Problem Description

```
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


```

## Solution

The soltuion is based Moore's voting Algorithm, we initializa a variable candidate and a variable count and initially (when count is equal to 0) we choose that our majority element is the first element of the array, and we store it's count in the count, Next in the next iteratation , if we come across the element which is equal to our choosen majority element, we will increment the count, otherwise we will decrement the count, (Here the count does not store the frequency of our choosene tlement , it just stores the Strength of or majority element, if we come across any element other than the choosen majority element the count is decreased ).

For example let us take {7,7,5,7,5,1,5,7,5,5,7,7,5,5,5,5}, if we choose our majority element as 7 in the first go, the strength/count of the majority element will be decreased to 0, once we reach the 5th index,
it simply means that in the subarry arr[0:5] 7 is clearly not our majority element, if it was the majority element, it's strength wouldn't have been, come to 0.
Further when we reach the 6th index. our count is once again,0 so we choose 5 as our majority element and increment the count.

The process continues. Once we come out of traveral the candidate variable would store the majority element (if it exist).

Note:- The variable candidate and count does necessarily store the majority element if it doesn't exist, i.e. If there is no majority element in the array , we would have to run an additonal loop to check whether the stored element is the majority element or not. In the question, it was mentioned that there exist a majority element,

## Solution

Java Code :

```java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int candidate = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
            }

            if (num == candidate) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }

        // for checking if the stored element is the majority element or not
        int cnt1 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == candidate) cnt1++;
        }

        if (cnt1 > (n / 2))
            return candidate;

        return -1;

    }
}
```
