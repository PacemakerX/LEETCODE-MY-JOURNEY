## Problem Description

````
Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

## Solution

To add two binary numbers, we must know the basic binary addtion, We should also know that the carry for adding the LSB's will always be 0.
In the Solution, we travese the array, from the LSB position( from the back of the String), we will traverse arrays until no element is left to b traversed,
Thereafter we will select two elements from the (from both the strings respectively) and add them, we use (a.charAt(i--)-'0') , The i-- will ensure the i will be pointing to
the next element after the execution of this statement and -'0' ensures that the character pointed by a.chartAt(i--) is converted into integer, we know that if the sum greater than 1 thent there would be of carry of 1,Now we will compute the sum (All the possbilities of sum is to be 0,1,2,3 if we mod the values by 2 we will get 0,1,0,1 that's the binary equivalent for sum) we will append the sum to the resultant ,upon the next iteration sum will be initially be equal to previosu carry, to add it to the elements.

At the end of the traversal we will have the string but as we apended each item, we had to reverse it before returning it.



## Solution

Java Code :

```java
class Solution {
 public  String addBinary(String a, String b) {
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        int i = a.length() - 1;
        int j = b.length() - 1;
        int carry = 0;
        while(i >= 0 || j >= 0){
            int sum = carry;
            if(i >= 0) sum += a.charAt(i--) - '0';
            if(j >= 0) sum += b.charAt(j--) - '0';
            carry = sum > 1 ? 1 : 0;
            res.append(sum % 2);
        }
        if(carry != 0) res.append(carry);
        return res.reverse().toString();
 }

}
