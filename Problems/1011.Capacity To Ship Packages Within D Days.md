https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/description/

## Problem Description

```
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within days days.

The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i]. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within days days.


```

## Solution

The solutions is based on Binary Search technique along with a greedy (check function). We initialize a variable max, which stores the sum of all the weights,(It also donates what is the max Capacity of the convayer belt to ship the package in one day)
Thereafter run a binary search while loop initializing start=0,end=max and
mid=start+(end-start)/2

We check the value of mid by parsing it to a function which tells us whether the number of days which will be required to send the weight at this particular weight limit of the conveyer bellt is less than or equal to the no of days required , If yes, we will decrement the mid value,

if no we will increment the start value,

At the end of the while loop the start pointer will be pointing to the least weight limit which will be required to ship all the weights withing the give no. of day

## Solution

Java Code :

```java
class Solution {
   public  int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int days) {

        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
            max +=  weights[i];
        }

        int start = 0, end = max, mid = 0;

        while (start <= end) {
            mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (numOfDays(weights, days, mid))
                end = mid - 1;
            else
                start = mid + 1;
        }

        return start;

    }

    public  boolean numOfDays(int[] weights, int days, int target) {
        int noOfDays = 0;
        int weight = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
            if (weights[i] + weight <= target)
                weight += weights[i];
            else if (weights[i] > target)
                return false;
            else {
                noOfDays++;
                weight = weights[i];
            }
        }
        noOfDays += weight == 0 ? 0 : 1;
        return noOfDays <= days;
    }

}
```
