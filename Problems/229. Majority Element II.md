## Problem Description

```
Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.


```

## Solution

This solution is Based on Moore's voting Algorithm, ([Do Check out  Question no. 169](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/)). The Intuition behind this problem is simple, firstly we need to know how many majority elements at most be present in an array of size n. Let us consider an example of {3,4,5,4,6,3,3,3,4,4}. As the question states Majority element must appear in the array for atleat 
Math.floor(n/3)+1, the size of our example array is 10, Therefore the majority  elements have to appear more than 3 times. 

On basic thinking, what is the max no. of the majority element which the array can accomadate, In our example we know that 3 appear 4 times, Hence it is a majority element, 4 appear 4 times hence it is a majority element, If we exclude themes elements, we are left with only 2 elements which, possibly cannot be the majority element. Even if both of them are same.

Therefore atmost only 2 elements can exist in an array, in which they appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times . 

We therefore, apply Moore's voting Algorithm to find out the which two elements can be the majority element, Also we need to re-check whether the our choose numbers are the majority element or not.

## Solution

Java Code :

```java
cclass Solution {
    public List<Integer> majorityElement(int[] nums) {

        List<Integer> ls = new ArrayList<>();
        int el1=Integer.MIN_VALUE,el2=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int cnt1=0,cnt2=0;

        for(int n:nums){

            if(cnt1==0 && n !=el2)
                el1=n;
            if(cnt2==0 && n!=el1)
                el2=n;
            if(n==el1)
                cnt1++;
            else if(n==el2)
                cnt2++;
            else{
                cnt1--;
                cnt2--;
            }
        }
        cnt1=0;
        cnt2=0;
        //To check whether the elements storedin el1 and el2 are really the majority element or not,if yes they will be added in the list
        for(int num: nums){

            if(num==el1)
                cnt1++;
            if(num==el2)
                cnt2++;
        }
        if(cnt1 >Math.floor(nums.length/3))
            ls.add(el1);
        if(cnt2 >Math.floor(nums.length/3))
            ls.add(el2);
        return ls;
    }
}
```
