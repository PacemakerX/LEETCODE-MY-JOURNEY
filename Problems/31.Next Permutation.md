## Problem Description

```
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

    For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

    For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
    Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
    While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

## Solution

The solution is based on longest prefix(used in dictionary), we traverse array from the last element , and search for the element which is smaller than the next element i.e.( arr[i]< arr[i+1] ) the first index which satisfies this condition is calleda breaking point, if there is no breaking point, it means the the Array is sorted in  descending 
order, it means that there cannot be no larger permutation than this array, Hence we would just reverse the array (it will be sorted in ascending order). 

If there exist a breaking point, now we need to find the next greater of the array, in order to do so we would again traverse the array from the back till the breaking Point 
and search for the first elememt which is greater than the element at the breaking point, Upon finding the element we would swap the element with the breaking point element and terminate the loop.

now we need to minimize the right of the breaking point(The element which was swapped in the last iterattion). We can simply just reverse the right half of the array, This will give us the next greater permutation.

## Solution

Java Code :

```java
class Solution {
    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        int ind1=-1;
        int ind2=-1;
       
        for(int i=nums.length-2;i>=0;i--){
            if(nums[i]<nums[i+1]){
                ind1=i;
                break;
            }
        }
         
        if(ind1==-1){
            reverse(nums,0);
        }
        
        else{
            
            for(int i=nums.length-1;i>=0;i--){
                if(nums[i]>nums[ind1]){
                    ind2=i;
                    break;
                }
            }

            swap(nums,ind1,ind2);
            
            reverse(nums,ind1+1);
        }
    }
    void swap(int[] nums,int i,int j){
        int temp=nums[i];
        nums[i]=nums[j];
        nums[j]=temp;
    }
    void reverse(int[] nums,int start){
        int i=start;
        int j=nums.length-1;
        while(i<j){
            swap(nums,i,j);
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
}
```
