## Problem Description

```
You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.




```

## Solution

This Intuition behind this question is cyclic sort,As we say that the array contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Isn't it obvious that we can sort the numbers on their respective index (number -1). For example,{1,2,2,4} The array contains, 4 numbers, we can place the elements on theirs respective indexes which are (the number -1).The correct position of 1 will be 0,The correct position of 2 will be 1, The correct postion of 4 will be 3.

We traverse the array from the start, and check whether the element at nums[i] is at it's correct index, by checking what element  is there at it's index, 
nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1] Will check is the element at it's corect Index or not, if not we will swap the element with the element present at it's specified index, if yes we will increment the index.
After The traversal of the array for the first time , all The indexes i will have their specific number (i+1), If any element which voilates this, it is our duplicate number.

Note:- Read the code carefully.

## Solution

Java Code :

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] nums) {

    int i = 0;
        int[] arr = new int[2];
        while (i < nums.length) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1] ) {
                swap(nums, nums[i]-1, i);
            } else
                i++;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (j != nums[j]-1) {
                arr[0] = nums[j];
                arr[1] = j + 1;
                break;
            }
        }
        return arr;
    }
n
    public static void swap(int[] nums, int first, int last) {
        int temp = nums[first];
        nums[first] = nums[last];
        nums[last] = temp;
    }
}
```
