## Problem Description

```
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

    For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
```

## Solution

The solutions is based on Binary Search technique. We initialize two variables start=1 and end=x and mid.
Thereafter we run a basic binary Search initializing
mid=start+(end-start)/2;if the squre of mid is smaller or equal to x, we will increment the value of start else we will decrement the value of end,

At the end of the while loop the end pointer would be pointing to the Math.floor(Math.sqrt(x)) value of x 

## Solution

Java Code :

```java
class Solution {
public int mySqrt(int x) {

        int start = 0, end = x , mid = 0;

        while (start <= end) {
            mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (check(mid, x))
                start = mid + 1;
            else
                end = mid - 1;
        }
        return end;
    }

    public  boolean check(int target, int x) {
        return (long)target * target <= x;
    }

}
```
