## Problem Description

```
Given an integer array nums, find a
subarray
that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
```

## Solution

The solution is very intuitive as compare to the Kadane's Algorithm, Firstly we need to understand the no. of negative numbers, if the no. of negative numbers are even then
we can consider them both , but if the no. of negative numbes are odd, then we cannot consider all of them, as the sum would not be greatest,We also need to consider the 0's we cannot consider 0 in the subarray, because no matter the elements of the subArray, the 0 will make the product as 0.

We come to the conclusion that the maximum product will alsways be them prefix And the suffix product of the subArray, We would simpley iterate over the array,and calculate the prefixProduct and the suffixProduct, the method we use takes into account all the prefix and Suffix products, and if in case we come acroos 0, we would just set the value of prefix and the suffix product as 1 , we don't want to carry the 0 product over the array. 

## Solution

Java Code :

```java
lass Solution {
    public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
        
          int n = nums.length; //size of array.

        int pre = 1, suff = 1;
        int ans = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (pre == 0) pre = 1;
            if (suff == 0) suff = 1;
            pre *= nums[i];
            suff *= nums[n - i - 1];
            ans = Math.max(ans, Math.max(pre, suff));
        }
        return ans;


    }
    }
```
