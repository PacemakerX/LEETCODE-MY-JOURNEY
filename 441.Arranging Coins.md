## Problem Description

```
You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.
```

## Solution

This is agian a binarySearch+Greedy question where we check whether how many coins would be required to make the i<sup>th</sup> row/stair.

To our notice to make a n no. of complete stairs we need atleast n*(n+1)/2 coins , therfore we take a lower bound as 1 and upper bound as n , to check how many stairs can me 
make in n coins,Since we are dealing with big values, we are converting our product to (long) if we the no. of coins requre to make the mid<sup>th</sup> row exceeds n, we would be decrease end else we would increase start.

After the iteration of the while loop end will point toward the complete no. of rows we can build with n coins. 

## Solution

Java Code :

```java
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {

    int start=1,end=n,mid=0;

    while(start<=end){
    mid=start+(end-start)/2;

    if((long)mid*(mid+1)/2>n)
        end=mid-1;
    else
    start=mid+1;

    }
    return end;
}}
```
